## Implemented Algorithms

### Braitenberg Collision Avoidance

More info can be found here: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle>

### Wall Follower Solution

A simple solution to this problem was acheived by following the right wall at all times. This is possible due to the fact that the maze is simply connected.
